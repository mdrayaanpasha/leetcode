# Leetcode Problems - Because Sleep is Overrated

Welcome to my Leetcode graveyard ‚Äì I mean, **collection** of problems I've solved. Some of these I absolutely loved (lol, not really), and others made me question my life choices. Either way, they're all here, immortalized in code and **maybe** some questionable logic.

## Why This Repo Exists

Because apparently, instead of chilling on weekends or having a life, solving algorithmic puzzles for hours is "fun".

## What‚Äôs Inside

- **Folders for each topic**: Arrays, Strings, DP (yes, I cried too), Graphs ‚Äì all the usual suspects that make you rethink your love for coding.
- **Code files**: Each file represents a problem I've conquered (_or barely survived_), with my brilliant and sometimes unnecessarily complicated solutions. Expect the occasional "WTF is this code?" moment.

## How To Use This

1. **Clone it**: Like you haven't cloned hundreds of repos before.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mdrayaanpasha/leetcode.git
   ```
2. **Browse the problems**: Just casually skim through problems like a genius, then realize half of them involve edge cases you didn't think of.
3. **Run the code**: To either bask in the glory of your own brilliance or question why half your test cases fail.
   ```bash
   # Run with Python.
   python name_of_file.py  # or whatever
   ```

## Warning

Some of these solutions were written late at night after too much coffee and not enough patience. Side effects of reading this code include mild confusion and occasional "Aha!" moments.

**Disclaimer**: This repo won‚Äôt guarantee a job at FAANG/MAANG, but it will give you something to talk about at tech meetups. Enjoy! üòÅ
